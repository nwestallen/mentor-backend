# mentor-backend

This is the backend for a hackathon project aimed at inspiring more minorities to pursue careers in tech. Our solution is a mentor-driven web app that allows
people who want to mentor young people to upload their background info, interests, etc. and returns a searchable gallery of potential mentors to users
who access the site.
